            <img src="../Assets/image3.jpg" class="left-image" alt="MarcusGarvey">
            <p style="color: white; font-size:18px;">My hero is Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. <br>Garvey was known as the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA).<br> Formed in Jamaica in July 1914, the UNIA aimed to achieve Black nationalism through the celebration of African history and culture.
                Through the UNIA, Garvey also pushed to support the "back to Africa" movement, and created the Black Star Line to act as the Black owned passenger line that would carry patrons back and forth to Africa.<br>
                 He also fostered restaurants and shopping centers  to encourage black economic independence. In addition to his support of Pan-Africanism, Marcus Garvey was a Black nationalist and believed in racial separatism. This made him a controversial figure in and out of the Black community.<br>
                 Despite his controversial reputation, Garvey’s legacy continued to instill pride and inspiration among many black people throughout the diaspora.</p>

            <p style="color:white; font-size:18px;">I chose Garvey because his commitment to self-reliance, empowerment, and cultural pride resonates with my own values and inspires me to work towards uplifting my community."</p>

            <p style="color:white; font-size:18px;"> The MOTIVES Personality Test provides a breakdown of different traits based on percentages, such as materialistic, thinking, interpersonal, and easygoing. In my case, I find some results to be accurate while others may not fully reflect my personality.</p>
            <p style="color:white; font-size:18px;"> For instance, teh highest score I got is for Easygoing(83%), this go with how approach life and interact with others. I try to avoid stressful situations and try to go with the flow. However if I am ever in a stressful situation, I try my best to remain calm with a leveled head.<br>
                The Thinking trait, with a score of (53%), also feels accurate, I often spend time analyzing situations and reflecting on decisions. </p>
            
                <p style="color:white; font-size:18px;">As for Interpersonal which is (30%), this is lower than i expected.I in fact value alone-time but i also enjoy forming connections and friendships with other and also having meaning converstaions.<br>
                Vital which is (36%), I would say is accurate, I am not a enegertic person.</p>
